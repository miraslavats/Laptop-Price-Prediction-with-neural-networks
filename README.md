# Laptop-Price-Prediction-with-neural-networks
In this project I am practicing building neural network regression models with TensorFlow. 

GOAL: practice neural network regression with TensorFlow and minimise the error when predicting laptop prices. 

Concepts practiced: One hot encoding, feature scaling, supervised learning

The notebook/project has the following structure:
1. Importing libraries;
2. Accessing the dataset & Pre-Processing;
    - data cleaning;
    - one hot encoding;
    - feature scaling;
    - test & train split;
3. Creaing, testing & Evaluating the model
   - building, compiling, fitting;
   - evaluating the model (with MAE);
   - MAE improvement graph;
   - Experimenting
4. Improvements
